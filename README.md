[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ShaunSpinelli/mikew-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ShaunSpinelli/mikew-server)![](https://david-dm.org/ShaunSpinelli/ca-collab-server.svg)

Below is the documentation for Michael's Production booking platform that was created as part of assessment for Coder Academy.

This application was created by [Caroline Evans](https://github.com/CaroEvans), [Fraser Solomon](https://github.com/fraserisland), [Shaun Spinelli](https://github.com/ShaunSpinelli) and [Isaac Powell](https://github.com/DeezyE) under the [GWSS](https://github.com/Global-Worldwide-Synergetic-Solutions) orginisation.

The site can be viewed [here](https://suspicious-bhabha-21b6a1.netlify.com/) and the back end is being hosted [here](https://mikewserver.herokuapp.com) by heroku.

## Summary

### Problem Definition

Our client is Michael Waye, a local musician and producer. Currently Michael collects appointment details by phone and social media, keeping track of upcoming appointments in Google Calendar and saving customers details in his phone contacts. Michael ran into many issues using this approach such as losing contact information, forgetting too schedule appoints and not being able to advertise his services.

### Solution

The client needs a place online where customers can get an idea of his music writing and production services, contact him and book appointments.

Broken down into features, the client should be able to:

- Log in and out of their account securely

- Update the information displayed (MVP+)

- View, accept, decline and cancel appointments

- View their calendar of upcoming and past appointments

- Edit their available appointments (MVP+)

While customers should be able to:

- Create an account with their email address (Google and  Facebook are MVP+)

- Log in and out of their account securely

- Get an idea of our client’s services

- View our client’s contact details

- Make and cancel bookings (within a reasonable time frame)

- Receive a confirmation message for each booking

## Application Design

**Overview**

## Project Management

Below is an overview on how the project was managed.

### Working with the Client

Meetings were held periodically with the client to ensure constant communication and feedback during development.

**Meeting Checkpoints**

6 July: Found our client. Asked him about potential problems with how he intends to set up his music consultancy business. We learnt that he did not have a website and no way to easily keep track of his clients and their appointments.

10 July: Showed client our user flow diagram and basic wire frames and he approved them.

12 July: Showed client 3 logo concepts, he selected one. Approved layout and design mockup.

22 July: took photos and videos of client.

24 July: Got client to fill out a questionare, his feedback will be used to improve on the site and get it closer to launch.


### Project Charter

**Goals**

To create a personal website which our client, Michael Waye, can use to book appointments with his music production clients, and give prospective clients a great idea of the service he is offering.

**Scope**

- 3 weeks
- 4 group members
- Sort out with client

**Objectives**

- Allow Michael to give people an idea of his service.
- Allow anyone to contact Michael about his services.
- Allow people to book appointments.
- Allow Michael to manage all his bookings, and users.
- Expose Michaels music production skills to the Web.

**Stakeholders** 

- Developers, responsible for development of application

- CA instructors - provided guidance for the developers of the project.

- Client - Micahel Waye, Music Producer feedback and direction of application.

### Project Schedule

![project schedule](./assests/projsched.png)

### Team Management

Roles where divided based on skill set, availability and interest in certain areas.

**Fraser** - Front end development direction, styling, API integration, Test design- front end

**Caroline** - Design Direction, front end development,client relations, Authentication and authorization on the server and client.

**Shaun** - Server side development, Dev Ops, CI & CD, Test design- back end ,Front end when needed.

**Isaac** - Security and data, documentation, Quality and user testing, Front end when needed.

Work was monitored through Trello. See [Trello](#trello) for more information.

### Post Project review

**Summary**

All features planned for MVP were completed on time and the client was satisfied with the application.

**Project Managment**

Occasionally bugs found there way into the production site. By having development branch that was live we could have been able to fully test new features before adding them to the master and fix bugs before merging with master.

**Future Improvements** 

- use a state management system on the client side like Redux

- Add payment method

- Set up recurring appointments

- Allow other music producers to use service to manage their bookings

- Integrate email notifications

### Questionnaire from client

Q: How satisfied are you with the site on a scale from 1 to 10? 
A: 8

Q: How easy do you find the site to navigate on a scale from 1 to 10?
A: 7

Q: What changes would you like to see made to the site?
A: I would like to see these fields in the contact form and/or booking form:
>1) Do you have an idea of what style of music you’d like to create?
>2) Can you play an instrument, if so, please list those instruments.
>3) Are you looking to record stylised covers?
>4) Do you have your own lyrics, chord structure or any other musical elements? If not just leave blank.

I also would prefer to travel to clients, not for them to come to me.

Q: Is there any functionality that you would remove from the site?
A: There a lot of info in the contact and user pages, 
I think you could hide some of the information until you hover over it or click on it.

Q: How easy do you find the site maintenance tools available to you as an admin?
A: I think it would be nicer to be able to see my bookings in calendar view.
I also think the space could be used more effectively in the profile layout so that I have to scroll less.
It would be great to be able to search through the users and contacts, rather than scroll through them manually.

Q: Do you feel that the site represents you and your business?
Yes.

Q: Do you have any additional feedback for us? 
A: Not at the moment, no.


## Project Management tools

### Trello

[Board](https://trello.com/b/OFAmrk4Z/producer-app)

Trello was used  to divide tasks, prioritise them and estimate how long they will take to complete. This is achieved through Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Done and Approved cards. Each card was assigned to specific team member who would complete them. Each card also had a check list of related jobs that needed to be fnished in order for the card to be completed.

**Card Example**

![trello board card](./assests/trello.png)

### Github

An organization was created on github under Global-Worldwide-Synergetic-Solutions. In there we have the master repository for our client and server application, these will serve as the production source code for the project. Team members will fork from these repositories and create feature branches from their fork.

![git flow](./assests/gitflow.png)

Each feature being developed will be on a feature branch, when done merge with your fork , then open pull request on master.

For back end, ensure all continuous integration tests pass on your fork before opening a pull requests.

For front end  after making a pull request another team member will do a code review to make sure everything looks good then accepts the pull requests and merges with master.

**Feature Branches**

### Agile

Our Agile Approach was based on for values:

- Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools

- Working Software over comprehensive documentation

- Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation

- Responding to Change over following a plan

We conducted daily stand ups on Slack where we share what our focus is for that day, usually picking 1 or 2 user stories to work on and what roadblocks we are facing. We also use Trello to divide tasks, prioritise them and estimate how long they will take to complete. This is achieved through Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Done and Approved cards. We again use Slack to communicate with each other throughout the planning, design and development process.

A call between two colleagues over slack.

![slack call screen shot](./assests/call.png)

Another aspect of our project that makes it more agile is that we have a continuous integration and deployment pipeline set up. So we can respond to change and these new features can be quickly test, merged and deployed to the website automatically.

When a team member makes a pull request on master for the client side we get a notification slack. We can review all the changes live in a deployed preview that Netlify automatically builds on pull requests before merging the changes.

![pull request on slack](./assests/pr.png)

Code Review where done on pull requests and also in person.
